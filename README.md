## About Me  
I am an enthusiastic and motivated learner currently pursuing a **BSc (Hons) in Computing** at the University of South Wales, Treforest. I completed my 12th standard in India in March 2024 with Computer Science as my core subject, which provided me with a strong foundation in computational thinking, programming logic, and analytical problem-solving.

I have gained hands-on experience in several programming languages, including **C++, Python, JavaScript, and SQL**. I enjoy exploring new technologies through personal projects, online learning, and practical experimentation. I am particularly interested in areas such as **web development, automation, and database management**, and I consistently work on improving my technical and creative skills.

Beyond academics, I value discipline, teamwork, communication, and continuous self-development. My long-term goal is to build a career as a software developer where I can apply my skills to real-world challenges and contribute to meaningful technological solutions.
