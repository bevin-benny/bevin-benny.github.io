## About Me
I am an enthusiastic and motivated learner who completed my 12th standard in India, graduating in March 2024 with Computer Science as my core subject. My academic background has given me a strong foundation in programming logic, problem-solving, and analytical thinking. Along the way, I developed hands-on skills in C++, JavaScript, SQL, and Python, which I continue to refine through personal projects, online courses, and practical experimentation.

I am particularly passionate about how technology can create smarter and more efficient solutions in everyday life. This interest drives me to explore areas such as web development, database management, and automation. I enjoy taking up new challenges, learning independently, and staying updated with emerging tools and trends in the digital world.

Beyond academics, I am a proactive individual who believes in continuous improvement and teamwork. I value discipline, creativity, and a growth-oriented mindset. My long-term goal is to build a career in the tech domain where I can apply my skills to real-world problems, contribute to meaningful projects, and grow as a professional.

Overall, I aim to combine my technical abilities and curiosity to pursue opportunities that help me learn, innovate, and make a positive impact.
